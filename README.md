This is a graduate research project being developed for the Florida Polytechnic University VTC Lab.

The goal is to synthesize the Raspberry Pi 3, Pi NoIR Camera, and RPLidar in an easy to use platform for students to experiment with computer vision concepts.

This is currently a python project but it has aspirations of being more.
